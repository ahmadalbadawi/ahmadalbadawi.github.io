**Abstract**  
With the widespread adoption of cloud computing services for data storage and outsourced computing, concerns regarding data confidentiality and user privacy have been mounting up, especially when the data is highly sensitive. There are several efficient encryption protocols that provide acceptable security
level for protecting data at-rest and in-transit. However, this does not apply to protecting data in-processing, i.e., while it is being computed on. This talk will be focused on the growing role of cryptographic techniques for solving this problem by providing privacy-preserving computing technologies.

I introduced three trendy technologies that promise to provide a paradigm shift in outsourced computing: Multi-Party Computing (MPC), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and Functional Encryption (FE). I presented real-world examples of their typical usage, capabilities and limitations.

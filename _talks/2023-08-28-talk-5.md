I participated in this workshop as an instructor and gave five lectures on the following topics:

- The CKKS approximate fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme (2 lectures)
- The OpenFHE FHE library (2 lectures)
- Privacy-preserving machine learning with FHE (1 lecture)

In addition, I supervised a hackathon session on applying FHE to solve real-world problems.

I participated in this workshop as an instructor and gave five lectures on the following topics:

- The CKKS approximate fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme (2 lectures)
- The OpenFHE FHE library (2 lectures)
- Privacy-preserving machine learning with FHE (1 lecture)

In addition, I supervised a hackathon session on applying FHE to build privacy-preserving machine learning models.

**Overview**  
The enCRYPTON Summer School on Cryptographic Solutions for Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) was a comprehensive program that covered the latest advances in cryptographic techniques for protecting privacy. The school was held at Sabancı Univeristy, Istanbul, Turkey from August 28 to September 1, 2023, and was designed for students, researchers, and practitioners who wanted to learn about PETs and how to apply them to real-world problems.

The school covered a wide range of topics, including:

- Mathematical background in cryptography
- Lattice-based cryptography and homomorphic encryption schemes
- Software libraries and implementation issues
- Privacy-preserving machine learning/data mining

The school featured a combination of lectures, hands-on workshops, and hackathons. This allowed participants to gain a deep understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of PETs.

The enCRYPTON Summer School was an ideal opportunity for anyone who wanted to learn more about PETs and how to use them to protect privacy.

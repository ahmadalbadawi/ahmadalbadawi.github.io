* Homomorphic SVM Inference of vector embeddings of images [URL](https://github.com/caesaretos/embed-svm-fhe).
  
* Private Support Vector Machines with Homomorphic Encryption in [OpenFHE-C++](https://github.com/caesaretos/svm-fhe). For an OpenFHE-Python implementation, check out Bill Buchanan's [example](https://github.com/openfheorg/education/tree/main/openfhe_svm), which is based on my C++ implementation.

* Benchmarking latency of CKKS core operations in [OpenFHE-C++](https://github.com/caesaretos/OpenFHE-Benchmarks).
  
* Actively working on [palisade](https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-development) and other related projects such as [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) and [Intel HEXL](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-hexl).
  
* Homomorphic encryption with continued fraction [cFHE](https://github.com/heewon-chung/cfhe).
  
* Contributed the BFV-BEHZ encryption scheme in the [PALISADE](https://palisade-crypto.org/) Fully Homomorphic Encryption library.
  
* And this [website](https://www.ahmadalbadawi.com) which is a customized version of the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) framework. I forked the project and made it my own by adding some extra features and design elements. This is not really an open-source contribution but wanted to acknowledge the "Academic Pages" project.

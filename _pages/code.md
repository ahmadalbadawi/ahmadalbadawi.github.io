* Homomorphic SVM Inference of vector embeddings of images <a href="https://github.com/caesaretos/embed-svm-fhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a>.
  
* Private Support Vector Machines with Homomorphic Encryption in <a href="https://github.com/caesaretos/svm-fhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenFHE-C++</a>. For an OpenFHE-Python implementation, check out Bill Buchanan's <a href="https://github.com/openfheorg/education/tree/main/openfhe_svm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>, which is based on my C++ implementation.

* Benchmarking latency of CKKS core operations in <a href="https.com/caesaretos/OpenFHE-Benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenFHE-C++</a>.
  
* Actively working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">palisade</a> and other related projects such as <a href="https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenFHE</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-hexl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel HEXL</a>.
  
* Homomorphic encryption with continued fraction <a href="https://github.com/heewon-chung/cfhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cFHE</a>.
  
* Contributed the BFV-BEHZ encryption scheme in the <a href="https://palisade-crypto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PALISADE</a> Fully Homomorphic Encryption library.
  
* And this <a href="https://www.ahmadalbadawi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> which is a customized version of the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) framework. I forked the project and made it my own by adding some extra features and design elements. This is not really an open-source contribution but wanted to acknowledge the "Academic Pages" project.

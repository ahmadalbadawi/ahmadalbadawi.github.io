* **Homomorphic SVM Inference of Image Vector Embeddings:** Developed a method for performing Support Vector Machine (SVM) inference on image embeddings using homomorphic encryption. <a href="https://github.com/caesaretos/embed-svm-fhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Code]</a>

* **Private SVM with Homomorphic Encryption:** Implemented a private SVM using the OpenFHE library in C++. An OpenFHE-Python version, based on my implementation, is available as an <a href="https://github.com/openfheorg/education/tree/main/openfhe_svm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a> by Bill Buchanan. <a href="https://github.com/caesaretos/svm-fhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[C++ Code]</a>

* **OpenFHE Benchmarking:** Benchmarked the latency of core operations in the CKKS scheme within the OpenFHE library. <a href="https://github.com/caesaretos/OpenFHE-Benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Code]</a>

* **Active Open-Source Contributions:** Actively contributing to <a href="https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PALISADE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenFHE</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-hexl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel HEXL</a>.

* **Continued Fraction-Based Homomorphic Encryption (cFHE):** Contributed to the development of a homomorphic encryption scheme based on continued fractions. <a href="https://github.com/heewon-chung/cfhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Code]</a>

* **BFV-BEHZ Scheme in PALISADE:** Contributed the BFV-BEHZ encryption scheme to the PALISADE Fully Homomorphic Encryption library.

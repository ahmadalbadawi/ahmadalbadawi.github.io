## Research Interests

My research spans three primary themes:
*   Applied Cryptography
*   Machine & Deep Learning
*   Hardware Acceleration

Specific interests include, but are not limited to:
*   Privacy-Preserving Technologies
*   Trustworthy Machine Learning
*   Parallel Processing and High-Performance Computing
*   Computer Systems Performance Modeling
*   Machine Learning for Cybersecurity

## Grants & Awards

**RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmatic Programme**  
*Award A19E3b0099 | S$9.9 Million | Feb 2020–Aug 2023*

Served as a **Co-Principal Investigator**, leading efforts to optimize fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for advanced manufacturing applications. My responsibilities for *Work Package II – Strengthening HE Fundamentals* included:
*   Designing fast algorithms for primitive FHE computations.
*   Extending the FHE arithmetic set to support more complex operations.
*   Increasing the usability of FHE to simplify application development.

<!-- 10 peer-reviewed conference and journal articles, 2 patents, 3 software IPs, and 1 software library were generated from this project. -->

## Current Research

**DPRIVE - Data Protection in Virtual Environments (TREBUCHET Team)**  
*DARPA-Funded | $15 Million | Apr 2021–Nov 2025*

As **Co-Principal Investigator** and **Technical Lead** (since Sept 2024), I am part of a multi-year R&D effort to build a custom ASIC for homomorphic machine and deep learning applications. My primary responsibilities include:
*   Developing novel cryptographic capabilities to support machine learning applications, such as logistic regression and CNN training/inference.
*   Coordinating knowledge transfer between the software and hardware subgroups.
*   Developing workload characterization and performance models for various hardware acceleration technologies.
*   Directing software-hardware co-design, development, and optimization toward chip tape-out and full system integration.

I am a dedicated researcher specializing in applied cryptography and privacy-preserving technologies. These fields develop efficient methods to secure data throughout its entire lifecycle, safeguarding it from unauthorized access and manipulation at rest (when stored), in transit (during communication), and in use (during processing). I have a strong publication record, with numerous papers presented at prestigious journals and conferences. I am also an active member of the academic community, having taught courses, built research teams, and mentored other researchers. Moreover, I have advised deep tech startups on designing, implementing, and deploying secure and privacy-aware solutions. My expertise extends to hardware acceleration, enabling optimized performance and efficiency for complex cryptographic operations.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to a more secure and resilient world. Whether through exploring the theoretical foundations of security or developing practical solutions, I am driven by the desire to utilize my knowledge and skills to create a positive impact. By applying cutting-edge techniques and technologies, I strive to solve real-world problems and deliver value across diverse domains.

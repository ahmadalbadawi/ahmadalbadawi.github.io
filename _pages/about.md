I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2018. I also hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Al-Balqa' Applied University, Amman, Jordan, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, respectively. I am currently a Senior Scientist in Cryptography at Duality Technologies Inc., New Jersey, United States, where I conduct research on privacy-preserving technologies, trustworthy machine learning, cryptographic engineering, and hardware acceleration.

I was born in Jordan and have embarked on a global journey that has shaped me into a worldly citizen. My diverse experiences in various fields and industries across Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States have broadened my horizons and given me a unique perspective. My insatiable thirst for travel, new experiences, and cultural immersion motivates me to take risks and continually learn. I am always excited for what the future holds.

I am a dedicated researcher specializing in applied cryptography and privacy-preserving technologies. These fields focus on developing efficient methods to secure data throughout its lifecycle, safeguarding it from unauthorized access and manipulation - whether at rest, in transit, or in use. I have a strong publication record, with numerous papers published in prestigious journals and presented at top-tier conferences. As an active member of the academic community, I have taught university courses, built research teams, and mentored fellow researchers. Additionally, I have advised deep-tech startups on designing, implementing, and deploying secure, privacy-aware solutions. My expertise also extends to hardware acceleration, where I focus on optimizing the performance and efficiency of complex cryptographic operations.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to a more secure and resilient digital world. Whether exploring the theoretical foundations of security or developing practical solutions, I am driven to use my knowledge and skills to create a positive impact. By applying cutting-edge techniques, I strive to solve real-world problems and deliver value across diverse domains.

I attained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore in 2018. I also have B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering from Al-Balqa' Applied University, Amman, Jordan, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, respectively. I am currently a Senior Scientist in Cryptography at Duality Technologies Inc, New Jersey, United States, conducting research on Privacy-Preserving Technologies, Trustworthy Machine Learning, Cryptographic Engineering and Hardware Acceleration.

## Research Interests

The main three themes of my research career are: 
1. Applied Cryptography 
2. Machine/Deep Learning and 
3. Hardware Acceleration

Specific research interests include but are not limited to Applied Cryptography, Post-Quantum Cryptography, Privacy-Preserving Technologies, Trustworthy Machine Learning, Machine Learning for Cybersecurity, Combinatorial Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithms, Parallel Processing and High-Performance Computing. 

My main research products are: 

1. GPU acceleration of different fully homomorphic encryption schemes such as BFV and CKKS.
2. Applying fully homomorphic encryption in creating privacy-preserving machine and deep learning using encrypted data.
3. Homomorphic CNNs: developing a privacy-preserving image classifier that performs inference (prediction) of CNNs on encrypted images from MNIST, CIFAR-10 and diabetic retinopathy medical images. Implemented on CPU (using SEAL) and GPU (using A*FHE).
4. PrivFT (private fasttext): developing a privacy-preserving NLP text classifier based on the bag-of-words model using FHE. PrivFT can perform both training and prediction on encrypted text. Implemented on CPU (using SEAL) and GPU (using A*FHE).
5. GI-FHE: developing privacy-preserving genotype imputation models that impute the missing genotypes of encrypted DNA sequences using FHE. Implemented on CPU (using SEAL).
6. AML-FHE: developing a privacy-preserving anti-money laundry system that predicts illicit encrypted transactions using FHE. Implemented on CPU (using SEAL).
7. CASHE: developing a privacy-preserving spacecraft conjunction analysis tool using FHE. CASHE can predict the collision probability of flying objects using encrypted orbital information. Implemented on CPU (using SEAL).
8. Multi-processor task scheduler via Particle Swarm Optimization.
